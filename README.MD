This is a simple .NET Core worker service that reads data from a Luxtronic 2 Controller for the Alpha-Innotec Air to Water Heatpump.

## Luxtronic 2 Documentation
The documentation for the luxtronic was not easy to find, and I managed to dig up a webpage where someone had figured it out using wireshark.
That webpage is included in the docs folder for referance if anyone wants to have a go at making something themselves. 
Some of the descriptions are a little bit strange since it was translated from German to English with google translate.
